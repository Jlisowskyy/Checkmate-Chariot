Definitions:
    - game phase - sum of figures with weights that symbolize point between mid-game and endgame
    - tapered eval - evaluation that is calculated based on mid-game and endgame interpolation
    - fullMap - bit map that contains all figures on the board no matter the color
    - pinned figure - figure that is located on the same line as the king and can't move because it would expose the king to check
    - unpinned figure - figure that is not pinned
    - MapT - type that defines moves possible to be made by a figure
    - msbPos - way to index bits in a integer number from msb bit to lsb bit
                                         msb, .............., lsb
               e.g for uint8_t index are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    - lsbPos - way to index bits in a integer number from lsb bit to msb
                                         msb, .............., lsb
               e.g for uint8_t index are: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
    - king ring - fields around king, which control by enemy imposes danger to the game
    - Board evaluation - Process of static evaluation of the whole board state.
                         This is metric that guides search directions
    - move sort evaluation - Simplified evaluation of the move that is used to sort moves in the search,
                             improves alpha-beta pruning efficiency. It is mostly based on well known chess heuristics
    - block map / block field map - bit map that all ones indicates field that are attacked by enemy figures.
                                    Main purpose is to contain fields which are unreachable for the king
    - allowed Fields/Map - bit map that contains fields that are legal moves for specific figure
                           when it is pinned on given position
    - SearchThreadManager - class used to perform all actions that are related to thread managing operations
    - StackPayload - class used to perform push operation on the stack saving at the same time amount of pushed elements,
                     allowing to pop entire chunk at once
    - Zobrist Hash - hash function used to generate unique hash for each board state, stands as an index to the TT table
    - ZobristHasher - our implementation of Zobrist Hash
    - TT, Transposition Table - table that stores information about board states that were already evaluated with all
                                necessary information to avoid reevaluation.
    - age - number of ply moves made from the initial state of the game (startpos or given fen position)
