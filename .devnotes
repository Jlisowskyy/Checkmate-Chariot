Important todos:
    - added guards and correct messaging for uint128

    - fully implement cmake thread amount detection
    - implement interuptible go depth and go movetime
    - checks wtf is going on castling inside MoveGenerator especially what tf + 1 offset means
    - TOTALLY OPTIMISE COMPILATION TIME
    - Check for bugs in search why returns null move

LAST ERROR:
